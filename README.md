# Dashtoon_submission
My submission for the assessment of the Generative AI profile of Dashtoon

Setup the Notebook:
  1) Download the notebook on your device.
  2) Install all the required dependencies using these in the command line:
     
                                      a) pip install tensorflow
                                      b) pip install keras
                                      c) pip install numpy
                                      d) pip install matplotlib
                                      e) pip install os
                                      f) pip install tensorflow_datasets
                                      g) pip install sklearn
  4) Run the notebook
  5) The dataset will be downloaded using the code from tensorflow_datasets directly.
  6) You will be asked to input the image file path for the image you want to test.
  7) Provide the correct path, and the code will return you the style transfer image.
